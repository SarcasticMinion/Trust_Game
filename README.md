# Trust_Game

I tried to recreate the Trust Game, as can be found [here](https://ncase.me/trust/). It allows you to simulate and get the results that you would
get from the original game, and also allows you to play around with the parameters mentioned in the game.

I started off with trust_basics.py which is just one round of the game, given the actions of the players.
"characters.py" holds the code for the different types of players that you can add to a simulation.
"trust_game.py" allows you to run the simulation and build the simulation with various parameters.
